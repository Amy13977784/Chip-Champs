# Chip-Champs

Chips or integrated circuits, can be found on all kinds of computers. They are capable of many functions and are, thus, very usefull. These chips are basically small plates of silicon, on which a certain list of connectable gates are connected. Connecting these gates, has to be done as efficiently as possible, meaning, the connections need to be as short as possible, cross each other as little as possible, and (as to not create short circuits) only one wirer can be used per gridsegment.
